Introduction: 
Date Night is a great resource to help out with one of the most stressful times of the day, Dinner Time! Date Night takes care of discussing what you want to eat or trying to just figure out what to eat by displaying a recipe for your meal as well as a drink to pair with your dinner.

User Story:	
As human beings, sometimes we get hungry. Sometimes the amount of options for meal choices is too abundant. I want something to take the options and select what I should have to eat and drink for me.

Technological Outline:	
The user inputs what they are looking for and a random receipt will come up on the screen with an image and instructions on how to make it. 
First step will be laying out what the screen and user interface will look like.  How the information is displayed on the screen.  
With HTML constructed we can go ahead and start building the infrastrure in which to gather data. 
Once data gets collected about what the user would like the output is made to look nice.
Finishing touches and bug fixes are made. 

Division of Labor:
Each group member has a dedicated task to complete.  Raw HTML by Rick, CSS by Brandt, 1st API Key (Drink) by Zach, and 2nd API Key (Food).

Conclusion: 
Deciding what to eat should not be a hard choice, let Date Night make your night.
